# IPC ATHLETICS RECORD DATABASE SEARCH

## About The Project
This project was created for the public to search the IPC/WPA database with ease when wanting to compare their times & distances
with those of para-athletics best.
Once submitted into the CS50P database I wish to create a more functional project
utilising **classess.py** and **Functions.py**
I chose this project as I'm apart of this para-athlete community and have always seen outdated tech & software
being used for us to receive the neccesary data that we require
VIDEO DEMO: ...

### TODO:
Create graphing system for users to see percentage time correlation for a specific WR
Create UI to increase user expirience
## Components of file:
**project.py** has all the code required for this project currently containing allfunctions classes
**test_project.py** contains minimal tests for project.py due to the layout of the code

## HOW TO USE:
Follow the prompts the program displays, you can enter as many search queries as neccesary with one run of program
but to stop this loop run Crtl + D on all operating systems.
If you wish to have one of your times or distances compared to these World records enter your time/distance
 with the following prompt otherwise skip the peompt by returning enter
The program should then return tabulated data including record, country, date time and wind as well as comparasion column if applicable
